# YOLOv4 Object Detection

YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4) is an advanced real-time object detection model known for its exceptional speed and accuracy. It integrates several innovative features and optimizations to achieve state-of-the-art results in object detection tasks.

## Features and Architecture

### Architecture Overview

YOLOv4 utilizes a combination of advanced techniques:
- **Backbone**: CSPDarknet53, pre-trained on ImageNet, serves as the feature extractor.
- **Neck**: PANet integrates features from different stages to enhance the model's capability.
- **Head**: Based on YOLOv3, responsible for final object detection and classification.

### Innovative Features
- **Weighted-Residual-Connections (WRC)**
- **Cross-Stage-Partial-connections (CSP)**
- **Cross mini-Batch Normalization (CmBN)**
- **Self-adversarial-training (SAT)**
- **Mish-activation**
- **Mosaic data augmentation**
- **DropBlock regularization**
- **CIoU loss**

### Bag of Freebies

YOLOv4 incorporates "bag of freebies" techniques to improve training efficiency without impacting inference:
- **Data Augmentation**: Photometric and geometric distortions to enhance model robustness.
